Developed by Benedikt Lenzen in Aachen, Europe with the help of
[many great contributors](https://github.com/cocur/slugify-symfony-bundle/graphs/contributors).


Features
--------

- Removes all special characters from a string.
- Provides custom replacements for Arabic, Austrian, Azerbaijani, Brazilian Portuguese, Bulgarian, Burmese, Chinese, Croatian, 
Czech, Esperanto, Estonian, Finnish, French, Georgian, German, Greek, Hindi, Hungarian, Italian, Latvian, Lithuanian, 
Macedonian, Norwegian, Polish, Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Spanish, Swedish, Turkish, Ukrainian and Vietnamese special 
characters. Instead of removing these characters, Slugify approximates them (e.g., `ae` replaces `√§`).
- No external dependencies.
- PSR-4 compatible.
- Compatible with PHP 7


Installation
------------

You can install Slugify through [Composer](https://getcomposer.org):

```shell
$ composer require cocur/slugify-symfony-bundle
```

Slugify requires the Multibyte String extension from PHP. Typically you can use the configure option `--enable-mbstring` while compiling PHP. More information can be found in the [PHP documentation](http://php.net/manual/en/mbstring.installation.php).

You only need to add the bundle class
to your `AppKernel.php`:

```php
# app/AppKernel.php

class AppKernel extends Kernel
{
    public function registerBundles()
    {
        $bundles = array(
            // ...
            new Cocur\SlugifySymfonyBundle\SlugifyBundle(),
        );
        // ...
    }

    // ...
}
```

You can now use the `cocur_slugify` service everywhere in your application, for example, in your controller:

```php
$slug = $this->get('cocur_slugify')->slugify('Hello World!');
```

The bundle also provides an alias `slugify` for the `cocur_slugify` service:

```php
$slug = $this->get('slugify')->slugify('Hello World!');
```

If you use `autowire` (Symfony >=3.3), you can inject it into your services like this:

```php
public function __construct(\Cocur\Slugify\SlugifyInterface $slugify)
```

You can set the following configuration settings in `config.yml` to adjust the slugify service:

```yaml
cocur_slugify_bundle:
    default:
        lowercase: <boolean>
        separator: <string>
        regexp: <string>
        rulesets: { } # List of rulesets: https://github.com/cocur/slugify/tree/master/Resources/rules
```

Usage
-----

For general usage of cocur/slugify please see [here](https://github.com/cocur/slugify/).

### More options

By default Slugify will convert the slug to lowercase. If you want to preserve the case of the string you can set the
`lowercase` option to false.

By default Slugify will use dashes as separators. If you want to use a different default separator, you can set the
`separator` option.

By default Slugify will remove leading and trailing separators before returning the slug. If you do not want the slug to 
be trimmed you can set the `trim` option to false.
